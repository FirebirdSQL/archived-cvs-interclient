The firebird/make.sh script will build interserver and will compile the 
java sources.

You currently need j2ee.jar to compile the java sources.  Set J2EE_HOME 
before running firebird/make.sh in this directory.

The firebird/makeDeliverables.sh script will create the file InterClient.tar
in the product directory.

#
# make "build" version on linux
#
IC_PLATFORM=linux; export IC_PLATFORM
IC_BUILD_DIR=`pwd`; export IC_BUILD_DIR
firebird/make.sh -build
firebird/makeDeliverables.sh -build

To install InterClient/interserver:

 1) Extract InterClient.tar to a temp[orary] directory, 

 2) cd to it  
 
   for example, 

     cd [temp]/interclient_install_temp_dir

 3) execute "install.sh" to install InterClient.

Interserver may be installed optionally.

Hi 

I recompiled the java classes with changes recommended by Torsten.  Using
a simple makefile

all: 
	javac `find . -name '*.java' -print`

Classpath has to be set to include the j2ee.jar from the j2ee 1.0.  The jar
file provided is the beta version, and some of the package names have changed.
